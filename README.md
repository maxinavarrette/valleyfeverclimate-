# Valley Fever Prevalence (VYF) and Climate 

## Summary  
This project is an exploration of valley fever prevalence and temperature and precipitation controls.
Valley Fever is a soil based pathogen that has been growing in prevalence year by year. It is endemic to the southwest and the majority of cases are seen in California and Arizona. 
While this project explores the entire southwest, California and Arizona VYF prevalence are the primary focus. 
I aggregated Census, Temperature, Precipitation, and Valley Fever Prevalence data to use in this project. State level analysis shows data from 1998 to 2022. County level analysis shows data from 2001 - 2021 for California and 2006 to 2021 for Arizona.

The statistical heart of this analysis is an OLS linear model applied to a long spanning county level 1895 - 2022 Temperature and Precipitation data set, to quantify climate change at a county level to use for analysis and visualization. This output of this model is then used in tandem with Valley Fever Prevalence data to allow us a little leverage to explore prevalence in light of climate change. 

## Tech Specific

Multiple tools were used in the making of this project. Namelyâ€”SQL, Python, and Tableau. 

The outputs of a Pythonic Jupyter notebook where pre-processing, eda, and statistical exploration was performed is included in the repository. Additionally a full version of the tableau visualization is included in the repo. Here is a sample:
